Accretio is an API, a sandbox and a runtime for social playbooks

#### Purpose

Getting involved in a community can quickly get tedious.

Accretio mitigates this by helping you automate repetitive tasks. First you write (or fork) a playbook, then the platform runs it the best it can, asking you for manual help when it hits hiccups.

I started to write this tool for people who can't necessarily afford to do X or Y, but can self-organize to achieve X or Y. I hope that we can collectively build a shared repository of effective playbooks for a varied set of activities, from simple friendly gatherings to educative programs.

#### Playbooks

Playbooks are a graphical representation of the finite state machine that describes how a social activity could run. They are compiled and executed by the runtime. There are some examples in the /playbooks folder.
